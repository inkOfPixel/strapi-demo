    "description": "The iPhone 6s is nearly identical in design to the iPhone 6. In response to the “bendgate” design flaws of the previous models, changes were made to improve the durability of the chassis. The 6s was constructed from a stronger, 7000 series aluminum alloy, key points in the rear casing were strengthened, and touchscreen integrated circuits were relocated to the display assembly. Alongside the existing gold, silver, and space gray options, a new rose gold color option was also introduced.\n\nOne of the largest reported hardware issues with the iPhone 6s was unexpected battery shutdowns. Apple issued a warranty for phones with a limited span of serial numbers, however if your phone doesn’t fall under this category, don’t worry — iFixit has all the parts necessary for the most common iPhone 6s fixes including dead battery replacements and cracked screens. We’ve got the best [iPhone 6s batteries](https://shirsh.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-6s-Battery/IF314-011) and [iPhone 6s screens](https://shirsh.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-6s-Screen/IF314-040) on the market, along with a complete catalog of other iPhone 6s parts for the less common part swaps.\n\nAll iPhone 6s repairs will require a [Pentalobe P2 screwdriver](https://shirsh.cominor.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096) in addition to standard precision electronics tools. Any repair that removes the battery from the chassis will require [replacement adhesive strips](https://shirsh.cominor.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-6-6s-7-Battery-Adhesive-Strips/IF268-025). All iFixit Fix Kits come with all tools and replacement adhesive needed to complete the repair.\n\nOnce all parts and tools have been acquired, head to iFixit’s [iPhone 6s repair guides](https://shirsh.cominor.com/Device/iPhone_6s) for step-by-step instructions on how to make the fix.\n\nThe iPhone 6s earned a 7 out of 10 in iFixit’s repairability assessment.
